    majoring in computer science and minoring in web programming and applications. \
    I chose to pursue in computer science because I was interested in coding after \
    taking a computer science class in high school. At that time, I realized how a few \
    simple lines of code can create something amazing and how problem-solving was crucial \
    to this field. Since I enjoy creating applications, I joined the Agile Software \
    Development & DevOps class. From this experience, I would like to gain new software development \
    skills and create a piece of work that I am proud of.", 
    
    "Some hobbies that I have are traveling, cooking, playing games (both video and board games), and listening to music. \
    I particularly like traveling because it is fascinating to visit countries and cities I have never been before while \
    trying new food and experiencing different cultures. One recent place I have visited is Vietnam (Hanoi), which had a completely \
    different atmosphere to advanced cities. I also enjoy cooking, playing games, and listening to music because they all \
    help me relax and keep my mind off any stress.", 
    
    "One interesting fact about me is that I enjoy drinking bubble tea and milk tea a lot. I have probably tried over 20 different \
    shops since I am always tempted to try a different shop when it opens. One of my favorite shops is called Teado, which is \
    located in NYC Chinatown. My bubble tea addiction explains why I also have a sweet tooth for any kind of dessertsâ€”from cake to ice cream."]
